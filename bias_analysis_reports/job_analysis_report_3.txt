DETAILED TERM ANALYSIS

Flagged Term: young
Categories: age discrimination, direct discrimination
Context: "We are looking for a young, fresh-brained sales ninja to join our team."
Severity: 5/5
Explanation: Explicitly discriminates against older workers based on age, violating age discrimination laws.  The term "young" suggests that older applicants need not apply.
Compounding Effects: This term's discriminatory nature is amplified when combined with "fresh-brained" and "sales ninja," creating a cumulative effect of ageism and unprofessionalism.
Suggested Replacement: motivated

Flagged Term: fresh-brained
Categories: age discrimination, indirect discrimination, unprofessional language
Context: "We are looking for a young, fresh-brained sales ninja to join our team."
Severity: 4/5
Explanation: Although not explicitly discriminatory, "fresh-brained" implies a preference for recent graduates or younger individuals, potentially disadvantaging older applicants with more experience.  Furthermore, it is unprofessional jargon.
Compounding Effects: This term reinforces the ageist implications of "young" and adds to the overall unprofessional tone set by "sales ninja."
Suggested Replacement: innovative

Flagged Term: sales ninja
Categories: unprofessional language, cultural appropriation
Context: "We are looking for a young, fresh-brained sales ninja to join our team."
Severity: 3/5
Explanation: This term uses casual and potentially culturally insensitive language that may not resonate with all applicants. It also projects an unprofessional image of the company.
Compounding Effects: Combined with "young" and "fresh-brained," this term contributes to a perception of the ideal candidate as someone young, inexperienced, and potentially aggressive in sales tactics.
Suggested Replacement: skilled sales professional

COMPOUNDING EFFECTS SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
The combination of "young," "fresh-brained," and "sales ninja" creates a trifecta of potentially discriminatory and unprofessional language.  It suggests a preference for younger applicants, potentially excluding qualified candidates based on age and contributing to a negative perception of the company culture.

RISK ASSESSMENT
----------------------------------------
This job description presents a significant legal risk due to the explicit age discrimination ("young") and a moderate risk of deterring qualified candidates due to unprofessional language. Ethically, it promotes an exclusionary image and may discourage older, more experienced applicants from applying.
