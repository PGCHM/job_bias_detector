DETAILED TERM ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------

Flagged Term: young
Categories: age discrimination, direct discrimination
Context: "We need a young, energetic salesperson who can work long hours!"
Severity: 5/5

Suggested Replacement: enthusiastic

Flagged Term: long hours
Categories: work-life balance, indirect discrimination
Context: "We need a young, energetic salesperson who can work long hours!"
Severity: 3/5
Explanation: May discriminate against caregivers and promote unhealthy work-life balance.
Compounding Effects: Exacerbates the discriminatory implications of "young" and "energetic."
Suggested Replacement: flexible schedule based on project needs

COMPOUNDING EFFECTS SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
The combination of "young," "energetic," and "long hours" creates a strong bias towards younger applicants and against older workers or those with caregiving responsibilities, potentially violating age discrimination laws and promoting unhealthy work practices.

RISK ASSESSMENT
----------------------------------------
This job description poses a high legal risk due to explicit age discrimination ("young") and the potential for claims of indirect discrimination based on age and family status ("energetic" and "long hours"). It also presents ethical concerns regarding inclusivity and fair hiring practices.

IMPROVED JOB DESCRIPTION
