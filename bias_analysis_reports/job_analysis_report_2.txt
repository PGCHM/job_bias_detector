DETAILED TERM ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------

Flagged Term: fresh graduate
Categories: age discrimination, indirect discrimination, experience discrimination
Context: "Looking for a fresh graduate with 2-3 years of experience."
Severity: 4/5
Explanation: While not explicitly discriminatory, "fresh graduate" often implies a preference for recent graduates, potentially disadvantaging older workers with more experience.  The conflicting requirement of 2-3 years of experience further highlights this issue, suggesting a narrow target demographic.
Compounding Effects: The contradictory nature of seeking a 'fresh graduate' with significant experience exacerbates the potential for discrimination.
Suggested Replacement: entry-level professional

COMPOUNDING EFFECTS SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
The conflicting requirements of being a "fresh graduate" while simultaneously possessing 2-3 years of experience create ambiguity and raise concerns about potential age and experience discrimination. This confusing language likely unintentionally excludes qualified candidates.

RISK ASSESSMENT
----------------------------------------
This job description presents a moderate legal risk due to the potential for indirect age and experience discrimination. Although "fresh graduate" is not explicitly discriminatory, its combination with the experience requirement creates a contradictory message that may deter qualified candidates from applying.
